# Capstone Project

###Why Build It?

- I like to track my skiing. It’s a way to help me remember a particular day on the slopes.
- I will enjoy using it and bring it out to remind friends and family about the day.

###What problems does this app solve?
- None that I can think of. I’m doing it because it’s an assigned project. 
- It is something that I will use, and enjoy using and improving on as a) my skills allow and b) the season goes on and I find other things I’d like to track.

###Principles of the app.
- Easy to enter information.
- Easy to retrieve information. 


### Index View

- Ski-type picture covering all/most of the page.
- Links to other parts of the site.
- Links will be represented with a look of a ski pass.
- Enter information about a New Day of skiing.

###Search

- At the bottom of the page, there will be links to:
- Copper Mtn
- Summit County
- Snowmass
- Road Conditions

### New Day (Need a better name)

####Each day of skiing will include:
- Date
- Temperature
- New Snow
- Snow Conditions
- Mountain (where I skied)
- Time I got on the first chairlift
- No. of runs skied
- Time I took the last chairlift
- Rating (arbitrary number from 1-5)
- Who I skied with
- Notes about the day (freeform)

###Photos
- As the name implies, a place to collect pictures.
- A collection of pictures fill the page. When clicked on, they become full-screen.
- Create a thumbnail so the photos aren’t too big. When clicked they take you to the larger picture.

###Log
- Will contain a list of all the days I’ve skied.
- When I click on a log date, information about that day will pop up.

### Search
- Able to search on: date, mountain, who I skied with, number of runs, comments, etc.


###IDEAS TO THINK ABOUT
- Weather/Ski API  http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/
- I’ve never used an API.
- What will I do with this? I’ll mostly ski at Copper. Will I have the current weather conditions? If so, where on the page?
- Use it to pull in information to the New Day page? Temp & New Snow?
- How difficult will the Search be? Hard to pull the information?
- Pictures: How will this page actually work? I’ll create thumbnails but:
- I’d like to put a white border around each picture. Maybe?
- Place the pictures in a neat row, or have them overlap? (If overlapping, how will I be able to see the picture underneath?)

###Further thoughts
- Kelly to design a logo
- Kelly to help come up with a name
- Pictures to be in folders based on . . . month?, day? with them overlapping on the folder
- Links on the bottom of the index page should take the user to a new page on my website - don’t let users leave my site
- Overlap the index page logos on the picture
- Use a graphic on the individual logs
- Incorporate maps/weather info for other ski areas?
- Can I incorporate the lanyard somehow?
