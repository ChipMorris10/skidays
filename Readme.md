# Capstone Project

###Name (I'm still working on one)

###Summary
A place to track ski days throughout the year with various pieces of information: date, conditions, temperature, ski area, who you went with, number of runs, and more. There will also be a place to collect pictures from the day, a quick-view of all days skied, and, if I can include it, a search area.

###Technologies
- MEAN Stack
-- Express backend
-- Angular frontend
-- MongoDB
-- Node.js
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

###API
- I'm still trying to figure this out, but it looks like weatherunderground might be the best one for my purposes. I ski mostly at Copper Mountain and they don't have an API open for developers.

###MPV
MVP will consist of being able to enter and edit your ski days, add photos, and have the API out-fill out some of the information that I'm collecting. I will also have the photos sorted by day?/month? in a folder, or folder-like system using CSS to make them look like Polaroid pictures.

###Why Build It?

- I like to track my skiing. It’s a way to help me remember a particular day on the slopes.
- I will enjoy using it and bring it out to remind friends and family about the day.

###What problems does this app solve?
- None that I can think of. I’m doing it because it’s an assigned project.
- It is something that I will use, and enjoy using and improving on as a) my skills allow and b) the season goes on and I find other things I’d like to track.

###Principles of the app.
- Easy to enter information.
- Easy to retrieve information.


### Index View

- Ski-type picture covering all/most of the page.
- Links to other parts of the site.
- Links will be represented to look like a ski pass and will overlap the picture.
- Enter information about a New Day of skiing.

###Search

- At the bottom of the page, there will be links to:
- Copper Mtn
- Summit County
- Snowmass
- Road Conditions

### New Day (Need a better name)

####Each day of skiing will include:
- Date
- Temperature
- New Snow
- Snow Conditions
- Mountain (where I skied)
- Time I got on the first chairlift
- No. of runs skied
- Time I took the last chairlift
- Rating (arbitrary number from 1-5, but represented with skis, or something other than a number)
- Who I skied with
- Notes about the day (freeform)

###Photos
- As the name implies, a place to collect pictures.
- A collection of pictures fill the page as thumbnails. When clicked on, they become larger.
- The pictures will be arragned by day or month with three pictures on the folder and when they're clicked they will open the folder to all the pictures in that month.

###Log
- Will contain a list of all the days I’ve skied.
- When I click on a log date, information about that day will pop up.

### Search
- Able to search on: date, mountain, who I skied with, number of runs, comments, etc.

###IDEAS TO THINK ABOUT
- Weather/Ski API  http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/
- Use it to pull in information to the New Day page? Temp & New Snow?
- How difficult will the Search be? Hard to pull the information?

###Further thoughts
- Kelly to design a logo
- Kelly to help come up with a name
- Will the links on the bottom of the index page  take the user to a new page on my website or take them off my site and over to Copper's/Steamboat's/Road Condition's/etc. site?
- Use a graphic on the individual logs
- Incorporate maps/weather info for other ski areas?
- Can I incorporate the lanyard somehow?
