Capstone Project

Who is it for?
Me (only me). It could be made available to someone else if they wanted it.
No need for authentication.

Why Build It?
I like to track my skiing. It’s a way to help me remember a particular day on the slopes.
I will enjoy using it and bring it out to remind friends and family about the day.
